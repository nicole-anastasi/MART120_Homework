        Welcome to the Houseplant Chasm style= text-size:24<br><br>
        If you have fallen in love with houseplants, you are in the right place<br><br>
        How do you know?<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows of your home are crammed with plants</li>
            <li>You have 3 or more specimens of a given species, i.e. Philodendron</li>
            <li>Any of your plants have pet names</li>
            <li>You tell yourself you won't buy any more, but do anyway</li>
        </ul>
        My Philodendron Gloriosum isn't this big, but it will be some day!<br><br><br>
